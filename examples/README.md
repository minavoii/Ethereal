# Ethereal examples

These are examples on how to use the different Ethereal APIs.

## Localisations

Using the `Localisations` API, you can add your own localisations at runtime, for both existing and new languages.

To create entire languages or modify existing ones without the need of runtime variables, you should consider using the `.json` files as described [in the wiki](https://github.com/minavoii/Ethereal/wiki/Languages).

## Randomizer

This is a more complete example that randomizes the elements, types, perks, traits and actions of all monsters on every new run.
It does not aim to be feature complete, but most of the work is there.
